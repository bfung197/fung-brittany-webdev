My name is Brittany Fung and I am a second year Physical Therapy student. All physical therapy students are required to have a minor in order to start their graduate level classes in their third year. I decided to pursue my minor in Computer Science. I don't have a lot of previous experience with coding, other than the prerequisites for this class. My interest in Computer Science springs from the fact that I come from a family of engineers. I hope to put my minor to good use in the future by possibly creating applications to streamline the communication between physical therapists and patients. 

This is my first time using Github, so I created this repository just for this class.
